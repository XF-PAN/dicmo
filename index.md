## Attentions  
There are some rules have to be followed:  
* the input data should be a tibble with a wide format  
* the column name of the input data could consist of English letters, numbers and underline - others are not accepted  
* names of columns that indicating alternative-specific attributes (including the alternative-available column) should consiste of the names of alternatives and attributes (or the "avi" argument) - they are combined by a colon, for instance, "attribute:alternative"" or "alternative:attribute".
